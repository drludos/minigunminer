# Minigun Miner

A Python game for the Ludum Dare 48th edition
	by Dr. Ludos (2021)

This tiny and very barebone game was made from scratch in about 10h, as a way to discover the pygame library :)
I hope you'll enjoy it!

***
Use your minigun to dig into the ground and collect the gold nuggets!

Be careful to avoid touching the ground! Hopefully, your minigun recoil will allow you to fly!

Use Left/Right arrows to aim, and Space to shoot (and also move!)
