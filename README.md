**Use your minigun to dig into the ground and collect the gold nuggets!** \
Be careful to avoid touching the ground! Hopefully, your minigun recoil will allow you to fly!

Use **Left/Right arrows to aim**, and **Space to shoot** (and also move!)

This game is made in Python with the PyGame library. This tiny and very barebone game was made from scratch in about 10h, as a way to discover the pygame library :) \
I hope you'll enjoy it!

For convenience, I’ve have also uploaded it to Replit, so you can play it online: \
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/drludos/minigunminer)](https://replit.com/@drludos/minigunminer?outputonly=1)

It might be laggy, and apparently there is no sound output, so I recommend playing on your computer if possible, but you’ll still get the core idea through the online version.

I’ve also added standalone downloadable builds *(working out of the box without Python installed on your computer)* for Windows, Linux and MacOS. They have been built with PyInstaller through Github Actions (Github’s CI/CD pipeline), so please report any issue you may have using them.
